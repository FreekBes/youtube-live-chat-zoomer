# Youtube Live Chat Zoomer
A simple light-weight Chrome extension that makes it possible to increase the size of chat messages in YouTube's Live Popout Chat. Useful for streamers who have a hard time reading the chat when the text is too small.

Also adds the option to hide the chat input locally, which can be useful if the window size is limited.
